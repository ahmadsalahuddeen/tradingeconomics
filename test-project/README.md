This is my submission for the Trading Economics project task. I have developed a web application that provides three different ways to visualize and analyze economic data using the Trading Economics API.

### Features:

1. GDP Comparison: Compare the GDP values between two selected countries over time, displayed in a line chart.
2. Country-Indicator Chart: Select a country and an economic indicator from a list, and view a line chart plotting the historical data for the chosen combination.
3. Country Snapshot Table: Choose a country and get a tabular overview of its latest economic indicators and values.

### Technologies Used:

- Next.js for building the React application
- Chart.js for rendering interactive line charts
- Trading Economics API for fetching economic data

### Live Preview:
You can view a live preview of the project at the following URL:

### Installation and Setup:

1. Clone this repository:` git clone https://github.com/your-username/tradingeconomics.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd tradingeconomics/test-project`
3. Create an `.env` file and add your Trading Economics API key: `NEXT_PUBLIC_TE_API_KEY=your_api_key_here`
4. Install dependencies: `npm install`
5. Start the development server: `npm run dev`
6. Open http://localhost:3000 in your browser to view the application

### Notes:
- The application is responsive and works well on different screen sizes.
- loading states have been implemented for a better user experience.

Please feel free to review the code and provide any feedback or suggestions. I'm excited to discuss this project further and appreciate your consideration.
